# simple-gh-sdlc

The GitHub PR-based software-delivery loop — the github counterpart of `simple-sdlc`. Same
ztrack-tracked dispatch loop, but the merge boundary is GitHub's: a change lands as an auto-merging
**pull request** gated by an independent `agent-review` status, not the local reviewer's verdict.
Five agents, each a prose skill the substrate runs model-interpreted:

| agent | trigger | does |
|---|---|---|
| `pm` | `cron */15` | the only dispatcher — sweeps the ztrack board, enforces WIP, **launches** the next eligible `develop` (review is automatic on the PR) |
| `draft` | `dispatch` | shapes an untriaged request into a verifiable Ready issue (sources + 1-3 ACs + evidence scaffold) |
| `develop` | `dispatch` | implements one Ready issue with evidence and pushes its branch; the substrate opens an auto-merging PR. `code:propose`, reviewed by `reviewer` |
| `reviewer` | `event: pull_request_target` | the independent GitHub reviewer: verifies the PR (ztrack green + every passed AC backed by cited evidence) and returns the bound `agent-review` judgment. `code:review`, never merges |
| `planner` | `cron` (daily-style) | keeps the board from drying up: reads the repo's declared vision and, only when the board is starving, files new **draft** (unlabeled) issues — the one thing nothing else in this loop originates. `tasks:author` only; never `ready`-labels its own issues, never opens a PR |

The PM (cron) reads each issue's state (a property it READS, not a trigger) and **launches** `develop`
through the Runner (`bun scripts/runner.ts launch develop --ref <id>`; the work item rides in as `--ref`
→ `$ZTRACK_ISSUE`). It does **not** dispatch review: the developer's change opens an auto-merging PR and
the substrate triggers the `reviewer` on it. The **merge boundary** is the `code:propose` / `code:review`
permission split — no agent holds both, none can land unreviewed code; the hosted substrate's trusted effect
publishes the bound judgment, then `ci` + `agent-review` green → native auto-merge (done = merged PR). The
local target retains a documented shared-credential compatibility path until it gains the same effect. This
is `self-driving`'s merge model, generalized to a ztrack-tracked SDLC.

The profile also carries an optional native GitHub approval adapter for installations whose branch
protection requires an approving review in addition to `agent-review`. It is dormant without
`OPEN_AUTONOMY_NATIVE_APPROVAL_TOKEN`; the configured identity must be distinct and write-capable, and stale
reviews must be dismissed. The adapter never substitutes for a human approval gate. See
[`docs/NATIVE-APPROVAL.md`](docs/NATIVE-APPROVAL.md).

`planner` (D3) sits outside that landing flow entirely — it only ever creates a plain GitHub issue, never
touches code or opens a PR, so it holds no `code:propose`/`agent:launch` capability at all. It exists
because a seed-only board empties (D8): `pm`/`draft`/`develop`/`reviewer` only ever consume or shape
issues that already exist, so a board with no human filing new requests drains to zero even while the
vision keeps calling for more. See `skills/planner/SKILL.md`.

Targets **`github`** (the PR/agent-review boundary is github's). For the PR-free local loop, use
[`simple-sdlc`](../simple-sdlc). The agents use [`ztrack`](https://github.com/volter-ai/ztrack) (preset
`simple-gh-sdlc`: PR at in-review, merged PR for done) for issues, checks, and evidence; the shared
`standards/` are read by every skill.
