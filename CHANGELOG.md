# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Restructured into a monorepo: the substrate-agnostic engine lives in `packages/`
  (`@open-autonomy/core`, `substrate-local`, `substrate-github`); the IR/Runner contract/
  conformance battery moved out of flat `scripts/`.
- Profiles are now first-class: `profiles/<name>/ir.yml` recipes compile to any substrate via
  `bin/autonomy-compile.ts` (`compile(profile, substrate) → installation`); added a runnable
  `profiles/hello`.
- OSS hardening: fixed a `pull_request_target` fork-escalation in the review workflow; added
  `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, a PR template, `CODEOWNERS`, `FUNDING.yml`; rewrote the
  README around the substrate model; gated the conformance battery in CI.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-06-16

- Added root control files, planner workflow, fleet preflight, governance
  reporting, durable decision indexing, and cookbook repository structure.
- Added template/testbed proof workflows for planner, preflight, and governance
  reports.
- Consolidated roadmap direction into `docs/ROADMAP.md`.
